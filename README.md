# Data Cleaning in MySQL
This repository contains a comprehensive example of data cleaning techniques applied to a dataset tracking layoffs in the tech industry from the onset of COVID-19 in 2019 to 20 July 2024. The project demonstrates how to identify and resolve common data quality issues, ensuring the dataset is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis.
# Project Overview
The layoffs dataset provides information on layoffs across various companies in the tech industry, capturing key details such as company name, number of employees affected, date of layoffs, and industry. This project involves:
- Identifying missing or inconsistent data.
- Normalizing text fields for consistency.
- Removing duplicates.
- Standardizing date formats.
# Objectives
The primary goals of this project are:
- To demonstrate practical data cleaning techniques in MySQL.
- To prepare the dataset for reliable exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization.
- To enhance data integrity and usability for decision-making.
# Tools and Technologies
- Database Management System: MySQL
- SQL Queries: Used for data cleaning and transformation tasks.
- Dataset: Layoffs data spanning 2019 to 20th July 2024, focused on the tech industry.
# Key Cleaning Steps
1. Data Exploration
- Reviewed the raw dataset for missing values, duplicate records, and inconsistencies.
- Identified incorrect data types and inconsistent formats.
2. Data Cleaning
Handling Missing Data:
- Filled missing values using relevant replacement strategies.
- Removed rows with critical missing information.
Standardizing Text Fields:
- Corrected inconsistent industry names (e.g., "CryptoCurrency" vs "Crypto").
- Ensured uniform formatting for industry categories.
Date Standardization:
- Converted dates into a consistent format.
- Duplicate Removal:
- Identified and deleted duplicate entries using CTE.
# Results
After completing the data cleaning process, the layoffs dataset is ready for analysis. Key improvements include:
- Reduced missing and duplicate values.
- Standardized formats for consistency.
- Clean, reliable data for exploratory analysis.
